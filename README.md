# minecraft-rftools-autocrafting
simple auto crafting, empower automation, fusion auto crafting, botania autocrafting using rftools controls minecraft mod

"simple auto crafting" and "alloy smelter" can run on same crafting station. 

for empowerer and fusion crafting you need put all matereals needed for crafting in "resource" chest. i dont know yet how to add them to rftoosl control auto crafting (yet) but they works well with refined storage crafter ant applied energistics interface.
