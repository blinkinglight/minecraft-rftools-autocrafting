# rftools controls autocrafting - simple crafting automation

for this automation you need 3 nodes set on channel "craft", first node name should be "craft" ant have on top rftools "workbench", second node should be named "card" and have some chest or other storage on top.
proccessor should have several tier 1 cpus, atleast tier 1 one network card and  "storage control module" linked to your rftools "Storage scanner"
and finally you need one "Crafting station".
last node should live somewhere by storage scanner. ( code is then its on top ) and that node channel is "craft" and name "dump"


after you add program to process run "net setup craft"


maybe you need some modifications in program where which where chest are.

for this program you should allocate 11 slots ( from 0 to 10 )
